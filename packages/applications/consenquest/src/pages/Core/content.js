# Project Overview

### Mission

**Help grow the Ethereum ecosystem to 1 million developers by introducing new developers to their blockchain 'a-ha' moment**

### Our Approach

**Build a 'Questing' platform that make the experience of 'a-ha' moments fun and easy.** Make the platform extensible enough to allow the community to easily create their own Quests. Make the platform not only interesting for new Ethereum developers, but also for those already involved in the space - to keep them around - by creating a platform which allows them to connect and collaborate.

- **Main Features:** A series of quests focused on giving users their 'A-Ha' Moment
- **Additional Features:** Rewards & Referrals
- **Timeline:** 2 Weeks

# The Rapid Team
The Rapid team is a small Research and Development team within ConsenSys. We focus on building prototypes and minimal viable products on Ethereum using decentralized technology.

### Project Notes
For the <strong>One Million Ethereum</strong> campaign we decided to push the limits of decentralized Authentication, Storage and Messaging. 3Box provides a suite of decentralized identity tools to enable rapid building of social applications.

#### Fullstack Javascript Developer
The One Million Ethereum was an interesting project to build due to the feature requests of curation by decentralized identities. A core feature of the project had to include the ability for the community (i.e. ethereum developers) to share content with each other. First starting with quests (a glorified tasklist) for learning about Ethereum.

<strong>The website use 3Box Storage and Threads entirely as a Content Management System.</strong>

How cool is that?

The gamification of educational or instructional material is not an entirely new concept; however, it is a concept which Ethereum makes immensely valuable. In Web2.0 game platforms, the rewards you obtain and reputation you build are not portable - they typically do not exist outside of that specific game's platform. What if that platform becomes obsolete or unsupported? What if you want to show your achievements to the outside world? What if you want to build another platform to interact with those rewards / reputation?

This is important because the stickiness of a platform is largely determined by whether or not the player feels as if he/she is achieving something. By leveraging Ethereum, we can build open, interoperable gamification platforms, where this sense of achievement is largely increased.

This application is the first step in that direction.

# How Are We Doing
**What do you think of the experiment?** *Do you like it? Love it!? Let us know!*

The website uses IPFS for **content management**, Decentralized Identity for **serverless authentication** and Ethereum blockchain to manage **peer-to-peer rewards**. In other words, it's still a **Beta project!**

Find a bug? Missing an important feature? **Let us know!**

# Build the Community Platform
**Are you a developer and community builder?**

Help build the foundation for sustainble online communities.

The One Million Developers infrastructure is interface agnostic. Built using 3Box Storage and Threads all of the dynamic content is stored in and retrieved from the decentralized cloud.

We want this to be an open, collaborative effort - contribute directly to the open source repo at https://rapid-eth.github.io/platform, or build standalone extensions - the world is your oyster.

**Not a Developer?**

Don't worry! You'll soon be able to create your own Quests and Adventures without needing to write a single piece of code!

**Can't Wait?

Reach out to the RAPID team at rapid@consensys.net to get onto the approved list of Adventure Creators, or to get your quests added to the initial Adventures we've established!

# Purpose
We believe that Ethereum’s success is highly dependent on the number of individuals involved in the ecosystem. Our hope is to provide a platform for the creation of, and interaction with, Quests/Adventures - which are interactive tasks designed to give people their blockchain ‘a-ha!’ moment(s). While the first version of this platform consists of 4 adventures established by the RAPID team, the next step will be enabling the community at large to build their own adventures using the tools we provide.

# The Adventure
Each Adventure is centered around a specific theme, and is comprised of multiple Quests. To complete a Quest, you will be required to perform the action outlined in the Quest’s description. Once complete, if the Quest involves a reward, you will submit evidence of quest completion (either your Ethereum address or a transaction hash) and receive a token certificate as a reward, if you’ve indeed completed the respective action. A token certificate is something developed by the RAPID team which allows the recipient of the certificate to redeem it for the underlying rewards (tokens!). Don’t worry too much about how this works (unless you’re a developer - then head over to our documentation to learn more!) - our platform will walk you through the process!

# The Rewards
By completing Quests, you’ll receive tokens! Initially, the tokens you receive will be DEV tokens. Only 1 million DEV tokens will ever be created; however, their value is yet unknown (besides their reputational value!). The main purpose of DEV token is to demonstrate the potential of the 1MD questing platform - in the future, when the platform is made more open and extensible, you’ll be able to create your own adventures, your own quests, and reward people with your own tokens!

# Vision of the Future
As mentioned, our goal is to turn this platform into a tool which allows individuals / teams from around the ecosystem to easily create their own quests. Through this, we’ll end up with a community-curated educational/informational experience that can introduce individuals from both inside and outside of the ecosystem to all of the amazing things happening on Ethereum. For example, a MakerDAO adventure might be created by the MakerDAO team to introduce users to their platform. Alternatively, a user may create an overarching “DeFi” adventure which includes interaction with MakerDAO. These adventures/quests will be both created and ranked by the community, making this an extremely collaborate initiative which needs your help to succeed!
