              Ethereum. Those who understand it won‚Äôt stop talking about it. Its following is almost cult-like - people who dive down the rabit hole seem to never see the world the same again. Those who are indoctrinated tend to never look back.
            </Paragraph>

            <Paragraph>
              At its core, Ethereum is the foundation for a new era of the internet:

            <Paragraph>
              Because it really is THAT cool. Because it really is THAT revolutionary. Because as soon as you have your ‚Äúholy shit‚Äù Ethereum moment, there is no going back. As soon as you understand this technology‚Äôs potential, you‚Äôll most likely drop what you‚Äôre doing and join the movement.

              The goal of this platform is to attempt to give you that ‚Äúholy shit‚Äù moment. Although it typically takes quite a while to wrap your head around everything, we‚Äôve tried to condense the experience into a nice little interactive package.

            <Paragraph>
              This is a difficult task, so we may not succeed. However, we hope that we spark your interest enough to get you to do some more research on your own, so that you may fully understand the technology and its potential.

I don't have to provision my own servers, I don't have to maintain servers‚Äîit's just Ethereum, and it's always there. I thought that was really cool on its own."</i>
